## How To Run Program

**NOTE** : After cloning, Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B8HAYDa-Fcbtcb3YYTY680KHa5EyloN-/view?usp=sharing">Network Classification Dataset</a> and place csv file to cloned directory (IoT-Devices-Classification).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Lovepreet-Singh-LPSK/IoT-Devices-Classification.git
$ cd IoT-Devices-Classification
$ python app.py
-- Now run address http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.
```

**NOTE** : This Code contains pretrained model which we trained. You can use that or can follow easy steps to train the model.
